## Capstone Project 2 - League of Legends Professional Games Dataset
## Michael Phillips

### 1. Define the problem
League of Legends is an online multiplayer computer game, with a rapidly evolving professional scene. In the past, similar games have come and gone. Due to its immense popularity and ongoing development LoL shows no signs of slowing down. I believe that in the near future the need for more in-depth data analysis will be necessary to compete at the highest level. 

Why is this important? Why does winning matter? I'll boil it down to the most basic of reasons, but still a requirement for the ongoing success of the league - money. Winning tournaments, and even just securing a spot in the new professional league will come with significant monetary rewards - easily in the millions of dollars over the next several years. 

LoL is an extremely complex game with many factors that contribute to winning a game. This project is meant to examine the data as it currently exists through Riot's API. Additionally, feature generation and machine learning will be used to find useful metrics that are not present in the raw data.

### 2. Identify your client
The potential client for this information could be one of two entities. 

- Riot Games, developer of LoL and steward of the professional league which has spread to countries across the world. The data and analysis found within this project could be used to tune and balance the game in an ongoing fashion.
