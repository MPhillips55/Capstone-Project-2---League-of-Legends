# Capstone Project 2 - League of Legends
# Machine Learning - LSTM Neural Network

## LSTM_NN_to predict_lol
This notebook contains the final project presentation, detailing the process, results, and methodology used in the creation 
and use of an LSTM neural network to predict League of Legends games.

### data_format.py and game_formatting.py
These python files contain data formatting code used in the final presentation notebook.

### data_formatting_for_neural_network and data_formatting_for_NN_pt2
These notebooks contain the neural network explorations, including parameter tuning and model structure testing. Software
tools used include sklearn, numpy, and keras.

### Feature Generation and Feature_generation_pt_2
These notebooks contain the data wrangling steps undertaken to prepare the raw data for machine learning, utilizing Pandas 
and Python.

### Time_Series
This folder contains an initial exploration of running the Python package 'ts_fresh' on the LoL data. ts_fresh was not 
ultimately used in the final project. This folder remains as an example of the steps taken to complete the overall project.

### df.csv
The final data used in model creation

### Image Files
